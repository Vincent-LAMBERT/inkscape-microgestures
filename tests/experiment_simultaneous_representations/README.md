# Experience Setup

This github projects has been used to setup the representations used in Experiment 1 of the paper *Studying the Simultaneous Visual Representation of Microgestures*

## Run the setup

This has been runned on a Windows 11 machine with Python 3.7.4 from its WSL2 interface (hence both .sh and .bat). You can run it all with both the `compute_reps.sh` and `compute_reps.bat` files.

Change the name to suit the first experiment by running the `setup_reps_name_for_exp.sh` and `setup_reps_name_for_exp.bat` files.
